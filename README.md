Project folder content
----------------------

In the project directory you see the following files:

      task1.py                Python script to the Task 1. Prints the query result to the console
      task2.py                Python script to the Task 2. Prints the query result to the console
      task3.py                Python script to the Task 3. Creates the file transactions.csv in the project folder
      task4.py                Python script to the Task 4. Updates the revenue column in the database. Prints 
                              the first 10 rows from the updated table to display the result of update
      task5.py                Python script to the Task 5. Other DBMS could be maintained with a help of SQLAlchemy 
                              package. As an example the query from Task 2 is implemented. The script should be run 
                              from the console with the connection string parameter (dialect and database file name, 
                              e.g. "task5.py sqlite:///transactions.db"). 
                              Currently works with SQLite and PostgreSQL, but other DBMS can be added. 
                              Requires SQLAlchemy package to be installed
